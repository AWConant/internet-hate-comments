Explain how to run your code here.

Our program is contained in classify.py file

Usage:
    python classify.py <training set> <test set> <optional: "out">

Usually we train it on training set (train.csv), and test it on one of the
two given test data sets (test_with_solutions.csv,
imperium_verification_labels.csv)

If you would like to see what the data look like after preprocessing, pass
"out" from the command line after <test set>. The files will be named as
follows:

<training set>_data
<test set>_data
